charging and dischargING of astable mood of 555 timer

Initially, when the power is just turned on,
the capacitor (C1) remain uncharged and
thus the trigger (pin 2) and threshold (pin
6) is at 0V. So, output of comparator A is 0
and comparator B is 1. Thus, Q1 is OFF.
• Now, C1 begins charging through R1 and
R2, indicated in THE Figure. When C1 is just
below 1/3 VCC, the output of comparator B
is 1 and the flip-flop is set. Thus, the
output (pin3) is 1.
• The transistor Q1 is OFF.
• When C1 charges beyond 1/3 VCC, then
the output of comparator B is 0. However,
the output (pin3) is still 1 and the
transistor is still OFF.
• So during the charging phase the output
(pin3) of the 555 timer remains HIGH.Once the 
voltage of the C1 is just beyond
2/3 VCC, the output of the comparator A
becomes 1.
• This resets the flip-flop. Thus the output
(pin3) is 0. However, Q1 turns on and the
capacitor starts discharging.
• Once the voltage of C1 is below 2/3 VCC,
the output of the comparator A becomes
0. However, the capacitor still discharges.
And the output (pin 3) remains 0.
• Therefore, during the discharge phase the
output of the 555 time is 0.
• When the capacitor C1 discharges just
below 1/3 VCC, the output of the
comparator becomes 1 and the flip-flop is
again set.
• Thus, again the charging cycle begins.
